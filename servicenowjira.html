<h4> Public Plans Provider Services Hire Task for Public Plans E-Business/ Fulfillment Task for Public Plans E-Business Tickets </h4>
	<p> These tickets are for employees who need access to the portal. Within the ticket itself it would say whether they need access to Beta or Production and which state they are requesting access to. A Service-Now ticket will be assigned to group “Public Plans E-Business”. Once the ticket has been received, the ticket can be assigned to you or you can assign the ticket to yourself. To assign tickets to yourself right click on the ticket and click “Assign to me”. </p>

<h3> For Internal Employees who need access to “HealthTrio Connect” </h3>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>A ticket will be sent through Service-Now by the employee’s manager</li></br>
			<li>Check to see which site the new employee needs access to (HealthTrio Connect Production or Beta for MA or RI) and whose access you need to mirror</li></br>
			<li>You will first look in both Beta and Production for MA and RI for an account for the user.</li></br>
			<li>If in the ticket it says the person was requesting access to Beta, but you find an account for them in Production, email them and verify which portal they need access to, and vice versa.</li></br>
			<li>If you find an account for them in the portal they requested access to you can confirm their account and then mirror their access to whomever they put on the ticket.</li></br>
			<li>If you don’t find an account for them email them stating that you did not find an account for them and in order to gain access to the portal they first have to register.</li></br>
		</ol>	
		<ul>	
			<li>There are email stationaries available for MA and RI for both Beta and Production with links and instructions for the user</li></br>
			<li>Put a work note in the Service-Now ticket explaining what you did.</li></br>
		</ul>	
			<li>Example: <em>"User was not found Production Connect. I emailed user stating they would need to create an account in order to gain access to the portal."</em></li></br>
			<li>If you had to email the user, change the status of the ticket from open to awaiting user info and save the ticket until they email you back with a confirmation.</li></br>
			<li>Fulfillment and New Hire Tickets should only remain in ServiceNow for a maximum of three weeks. When you first see the ticket, check both the MA and RI portals to see if the person the ticket is for has a confirmed or pending account. If there is no account, email them using the <b>“Connect Registration Internal”</b> stationary found in the Connect mailbox. Make a note of this in the “work notes” section of the ticket after you have emailed them.</li></br>
			<li><b>First attempt</b> comment: An email has been sent to the user to register. This is the first attempt. On the third attempt the ticket will be closed.</li></br>
			<li>If they have not reached out within a week of the first email, resend the email and CC the manager listed in the ticket. This is the second time you are trying to contact them. Note this second attempt in the “work notes” section of the ticket.</li></br>
			<li><b>Second attempt comment:</b> An email has been sent to the user and their manager/supervisor. This is the second attempt. On the third attempt the ticket will be closed.</li></br>
			<li>If they still have not contacted you within a week of the second attempt, email the user with the <b>“Expired Ticket”</b> stationary found in the Connect mailbox. Be sure to CC their manager as well. You can now close the ticket.</li></br>
			<li><b>Expired ticket comment:</b> Ticket closed due to lack of response.</li></br>
			<li>If the user registers and responds with “Connect registration complete”, confirm the account, mirroring the person requested. Leave a work note stating that the user is all set and close the ticket.</li></br>
	</p>
		<p> For example, if an employee requests access to MA Prod but hasn’t yet registered. </p>

<h2 id="First_Servicenowjira_Point_Header"> Confirming Internal Employee’s Accounts: </h2>
	<p> After you confirm the user’s account, you want to let them know that their account has been confirmed by sending an email to them and update the Service-Now ticket </br></br>
	On the Connect site you will use the following functionalities to approve pending user accounts: </br></br>
	 </p>
		<ol>
			<li> Access List Manager </li>
			<li> Applicant Confirmations </li>
			<li> System Admin </li>
		</ol>
<p> These functionalities are located on the left hand column in the User Administration section. The order of which to use these are typically System Admin, Access List Manager, and then Applicant Confirmation </p>

<p> <b>System Admin:</b> System Admin is a search function for all users on Connect. You can search either by the user’s last name, user ID or company name. You can see whether they are a provider or member, if they have admin access or are a regular user, what their login user ID is, etc. This function is very useful. You will also need this function to add or delete accounts, add new roles, or for finding the Entity List Name for the Access List of the user. You can also create new accounts using this function by pressing the Add User button. When a new user is created a PDF user agreement is generated with the user’s log in information. </p>
<p> <b>Access List Manager:</b> You will use this function <b>1-THPP-</b> to search for, modify, and approve the Access Lists. You can also search for an Access List by its name or TIN-Practice (tax ID.) The Access List holds the following: TIN, Hospital ID, Practice ID, and Provider ID. Every provider account is linked to their company’s Access List. If the Access List lacks the proper information, the provider will be unable to properly view or create: claims, EOPs, authorizations, or affiliate providers. You can only add one TIN, Hospital ID, Practice ID, or Provider ID at a time to an Access Container. Open a new or preexisting Access Container and select the options from the drop down list on the New Access List Core Physicians LLC. Use the search function to find the matching TIN, Hospital ID, Practice ID, and Provider ID <b>(don’t leave spaces)</b>.Once you select the right Valid Value List  the page will reset. After it resets click Return to Access List Manager in the center. You are also able to delete single Entity Groupings, <b>but be careful because you could ruin the provider’s access.</b> If the Access List Name field lacks <b>1-THPP-</b> , you can confirm the list by inserting <b>1-THPP-</b> into the field at the beginning of the company and pressing the submit button<b>(don’t leave any spaces)</b>. You can only approve the Access list if it has matching: TIN, Hospital ID, Practice ID, or Provider ID. If the Access List is missing any of these, you must not confirm it. <b>Make sure that there are not any preexisting "1-THPP-" or "1-NH-" confirmed Access Lists of the same name and information before you confirm a new Access List.</b>  You want to avoid creating duplicates. After you have added all the proper information press the select button at the bottom to save any and all changes. <b>Certain changes cannot be undone so be careful when editing.</b> </p>
<p> <b>Applicant Confirmations:</b> You will use this function to search for pending accounts. Make sure that the User field is set to Last Name and the Portal field is set to Provider. Type the prospective user’s name in the blank name field <b>(you do not need to type the whole name)</b>. Make sure you have Starts With selected. Find the pending account and press select. To approve the pending account you need to confirm two things: the selected Role matches what is on the user agreement and that the Access List is confirmed with <b>1-THPP-</b> —if the access list name is not confirmed you <b>cannot approve</b> the account. If this is a new Access List due to this being the first person from the practice to register, such as in the case of an owner who recently became contracted, update the name of the Access List to include <b>1-THPP-</b> before the name of the practice. Make sure that the correct Officer has signed the user agreement before proceeding. Save your changes and confirm the account. Every confirmed Connect user account must have a <b>1-THPP-</b> confirmation Access List. If the Access List does not have a <b>1-NH-, 1-THPP- or 1-THP-</b> confirmation you will have to search for it in the Access List Manager. Once you find the right Access List copy and paste the ID number into the search function on the Applicant Confirmation Detail in the access list section. Then select the <b>1-THP-</b> access lists that has the matching TIN on the user agreement. If there were multiple <b>1-THP-</b> access lists with the same TIN select the one with the most users. Afterwards if the role does not match what’s on the User Agreement you can change it by clicking on the dropdown and then selecting the proper role. This must be done <b>AFTER</b> selecting the correct Access List otherwise it will be reset to the original role selected. You can then press the confirm button and get a confirmation message, and the user will be added to the system. You cannot confirm an employee account without first confirming the Main Office Manager’s administrative account. </p>
<p> These three functions are all case sensitive, so make sure you don’t leave extra spaces, letters, or numbers when you make a search. When searching for the name of an Entity on Access List Manager it’s better to copy only some of the name and paste it into the search field. This way you are likely to get more search results. </p>

<h3 id="Third_Servicenowjira_Point_Header"> Password Resets </h3>
<p>
 User IDs and passwords to access the Connect Provider Portal are created and generated by HealthTrio Production support via the web portal. They are not created nor generated by the E-Business team via the Tufts Sponsor Configuration tools.</br>
Primary registrants are assigned non-temporary passwords during new user registration. Additional users added by the primary registrant during new user registration are assigned temporary passwords.</br></br>
</p>
	<ul>
		<li> All temporary passwords have a 24-hour expiration time. This expiration time is set by HealthTrio Connect and not configurable in sponsor configuration tools. Non-temporary passwords that are self-designated by the user have a 90-day expiration time. </li>
		<li> Password reset is a Production support feature by HealthTrio. The E-Business team cannot generate temporary or non-temporary passwords for a user. </li>
		<li> During a password reset Production call, if HealthTrio is able to confirm all of the below with the user, HealthTrio will assign the user a temporary password </li>
		<li> The only password reset ticket you would get in JIRA would be if the provider is the MOC. (Refer to HealthTrio Password Reset Process in the “For the Intern” folder)</li>
	</ul>
<h4> For Internal Employees: </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> Password resets for Internal employees will come into ServiceNow as Incident Tickets </li>
		<li> Search for the user by last name in the portal instance they are requesting the reset for </li>
		<li> Organize the list of results by company name and scroll down to Tufts Health Plan. This will make it easier to find the employee who needs their password reset. </li>

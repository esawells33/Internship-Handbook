<h2> Typical Work Day </h2>
	<h3> Each day is different and you will have a variety of things to do but you should start your morning by:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Checking your email and the Connect mailbox </li>
			<li> Checking JIRA and Service Now for any recent/new tickets </li>
			<li> Checking user agreements in RightFax (you have five business days to complete a user agreement from the date of submission; it’s better to complete them ASAP because they can pile up quickly) </li>

			<li> Run EDI Reports for MA and RI and save them to the correct folders </li>
			<li> Update the Traceability Log </li>
		</ul>

Also, it is helpful to know others in the office to feel comfortable, answer questions, and build a professional relationship. </p>

	<h3> Email a provider about their user agreement if:</h3>
		<ul>

			<li> The wrong Officer/Signatory for the TIN has signed the form </li>
